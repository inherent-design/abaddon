# Abaddon Framework - Session State & Development Roadmap

## Current State: Enhanced Platform Intelligence (Complete) + Coordination Design (Proposed)

### Architecture Overview: The Banana Principle
**Mission**: Create an application-agnostic host/platform library that can implement ALL of empack functionality in 400-600 lines using Abaddon primitives. No jungle-building, no monkey-designing, no universe-creating. Just grab the banana.

```

### Test Results: 45/45 Platform+Tool-Detection Passing (100% Success Rate) â†’ Target: 500+ Tests
```
Coordination Layer: TBD tests           # Core registry + messaging
Environmental Layer: 45 tests (100%)   # Unified environment + tty

Refactor platform module and implement tool-detection:
```bash
# Current: platform.sh (monolithic)
# Target: platform.sh (core) + tool-detection.sh (intelligence)

**P2 Refactoring Required**: Cache â†’ security â†’ datatypes dependency chain must adapt to new P1
**Blocks**: All adaptive work depends on this foundation

#### 2. **Adaptive Module Implementation** (New P2 Module)
Williams-inspired algorithmic foundation:
```bash
# New abaddon-adaptive.sh - Core algorithms for pressure-sensitive systems

help_init() {
    load_help_content_from_commands_registry     # P3 commands
    load_workflow_help_from_registry             # P3 workflows  
    integrate_adaptive_help_suggestions          # Capability-driven guidance
    enable_dynamic_help_generation
}
```

#### 5. **Cross-Module Adaptive Integration** (Strategic Horizon)
