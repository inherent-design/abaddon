# Circular Dependencies and Brain Architecture

I had a circular dependency problem. Platform detection needed tools, tool detection needed platform info. Classic chicken-and-egg.

Most people would just pick an order and move on. I started thinking about how brains work.

## The Problem

```bash
platform.sh ↔ tool-detection.sh  # Who loads first?
```

Your platform module can't detect capabilities without knowing what tools are available. Your tool detection can't find tools without knowing what platform it's running on. They need each other, but somebody has to go first.

Standard solutions:
- Bootstrap with minimal assumptions
- Hardcode platform detection
- Combine everything into one massive file

I wanted something better.

## Brain Tangent

Human brains don't have this problem. Your visual cortex doesn't wait for memory to load before processing images. Different brain regions just coordinate when they need to.

No rigid dependency chains. Just communication.

So I thought: what if software modules worked like brain regions?

```bash
# Initial bio-inspired idea
abaddon-reptilian.sh   # Core survival functions
abaddon-limbic.sh      # Memory and learning  
abaddon-cortex.sh      # Higher reasoning
abaddon-sensory.sh     # Environmental input
```

Each module coordinates with others dynamically. No loading order. Pure coordination.

## Reality Check

Three problems with bio-metaphors in code:

1. **Jargon overhead** - "Edit the reptilian module" sounds insane
2. **File structure matters** - Current 15-file split works for maintainability
3. **Context limits** - Bigger files are harder to work with

The insight was right (coordination over hierarchy), but the implementation needed translation.

## Actual Solution

```bash
# What I built instead
Coordination Layer:
├── core.sh         - Module registry and messaging

Environmental Layer:  
├── environment.sh   - Unified platform + tool detection
└── tty.sh          - Terminal interface

Everything Else:
└── Gains coordination capabilities, otherwise unchanged
```

Key changes:
- Merged `platform.sh` + `tool-detection.sh` into `environment.sh` (eliminates circular dependency)
- Enhanced `core.sh` with module registry (enables coordination)
- Added messaging to existing modules (preserves structure)

## How It Works

1. **Environment unification** - Platform and tool detection are really the same concern: "what can this system do?"
2. **Capability registry** - Modules register what they provide, query what others offer
3. **Dynamic discovery** - Any module can ask "who handles memory pressure?" instead of hardcoding dependencies

The circular dependency disappeared because the two circularly-dependent things became one thing.

## What I Learned

Biology provided the pattern (coordination beats rigid hierarchy), but engineering constraints shaped the implementation (registry pattern with familiar terminology).

Sometimes architectural problems aren't really about the code - they're about questioning your assumptions. Platform detection and tool detection felt like separate concerns, but they're really the same thing: environmental sensing.

Circular dependencies often indicate that two things should be one thing.

The brain metaphor was useful for seeing past dependency chains toward coordination patterns, but I didn't need to build actual brain-like modules to apply the insight.
